# GUI for Predicting Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus from Voice Recordings

## Overview
This application, developed as part of my academic and professional pursuits in medicine, uses machine learning to estimate Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) likelihood from voice recordings. It's based on a model from academic research, showing varied accuracy.

## Technical Details
- **Accuracy:** Optimal accuracy of 75%±22%, specificity of 77%±29%, and sensitivity of 73%±23% in the matched dataset.
- **Test Set Performance:** 89% accuracy, 91% specificity, and 71% sensitivity.

### How is this possible?
T2DM seems to create changes to voice amplitude, frequency, harmonic noise, jitter, phonation time, shimmer, and voice turbulence.

## Installation
If you don't understand the following instructions, ask ChatGPT to explain them:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Start the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.

## Attribution
Algorithm and methodology adapted from [this study](https://www.mcpdigitalhealth.org/article/S2949-7612(23)00073-1/fulltext).

## Contributions and Acknowledgements
I've adapted the original code and added a Streamlit interface. This project reflects my passion for merging medicine and technology.

## Limitations and Use
This is a conceptual tool and not a substitute for professional medical advice. Accuracy depends on datasets and conditions similar to those in the original study.

## To-Do
- [x] Adapt core algorithm
- [x] Streamlit frontend
- [ ] Testing with more diverse voice samples
- [ ] Online community engagement for informal testing
- [ ] Local community study in collaboration with healthcare professionals
- [ ] Algorithm optimization and improvement
- [ ] If there's potential as a screening tool: development of open source smartphone application.
- [ ] Planning a formal study for efficacy validation
