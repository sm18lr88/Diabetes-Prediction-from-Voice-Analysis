# Diabetes-Prediction-from-Voice-Analysis

This application uses machine learning to analyze voice recordings and predict the likelihood of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. It is based on acoustic features extracted from the voice recording and implements a model that was studied and reported in academic research.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the required Python libraries. You can install these using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
To start the Streamlit application, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Attribution
The code for feature extraction and machine learning analysis is based on the work done by Jaycee M. Kaufman, Anirudh Thommandram, and Yan Fossat in their study titled [Acoustic Analysis and Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Using Smartphone-Recorded Voice Segments](https://www.mcpdigitalhealth.org/article/S2949-7612(23)00073-1/fulltext).

## Contribution:
I'm not a data scientist or ML expert. I just slightly modified the author's code and created a streamlit frontend. This whole project may be totally inaccurate.

## Warning:
This app allows you to use any voice recording. Only the datasets used by the original paper can be said to be valid in reproducing the accuracy of the prediction. The app has more information on this.
